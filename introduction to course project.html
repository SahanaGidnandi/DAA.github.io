    <h1>Introduction to Design and Analysis of Algorithms</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <p>
            The course <strong>Design and Analysis of Algorithms</strong> delves into the fundamental concepts of algorithmic problem-solving, 
            emphasizing both the theoretical and practical aspects. It serves as a cornerstone for understanding how to create efficient solutions 
            to computational problems by studying the intricacies of algorithm design and performance analysis.
        </p>

        <h2>What is the course about?</h2>
        <p>
            This course focuses on equipping students with the skills to design algorithms, analyze their efficiency in terms of time and space, 
            and apply them to solve real-world problems. It covers essential algorithmic paradigms such as divide and conquer, greedy strategies, 
            dynamic programming, and backtracking, alongside foundational mathematical tools for analyzing algorithm complexity.
        </p>

        <h2>What kind of data structures and algorithms have you studied?</h2>
        <p>Throughout the course, various data structures and algorithms have been explored, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Data Structures:</strong> Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, heaps, hash tables, trees (binary trees, binary search trees, 
                AVL trees, 2-3 trees), and graphs (representation and traversal techniques).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Algorithms:</strong> Sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort, heapsort), searching algorithms (linear and binary search), 
                graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra's), and advanced algorithms for optimization and problem-solving.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How do you connect the course with real-time applications?</h2>
        <p>The concepts learned in this course have extensive real-time applications, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Optimized Searching and Sorting:</strong> Used in databases, search engines, and e-commerce platforms to handle vast amounts 
                of data efficiently.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Graph Algorithms:</strong> Applied in navigation systems, social networks, and communication networks for route optimization 
                and connectivity analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong> Used in bioinformatics (sequence alignment), financial modeling (portfolio optimization), and 
                AI (game theory and decision-making).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Tree Structures:</strong> Crucial for organizing data in file systems, hierarchical databases, and autocompletion features in 
                search bars.
            </li>

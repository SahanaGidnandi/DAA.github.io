        <!-- Section 1: Kinds of Problems in Nature -->
        <h2>1. Kinds of Problems in Nature (Iteration, Recursion, Backtracking)</h2>
        <p>
            Nature is full of complex processes that can be modeled using algorithms such as iteration, recursion, and backtracking. 
            For example, iteration is commonly used for repetitive tasks like searching or processing data. Recursion can be found in 
            patterns like tree branching or fractals in nature. Backtracking is used to explore all possibilities, such as in pathfinding.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 2: Space and Time Efficiency -->
        <h2>2. Space and Time Efficiency</h2>
        <p>
            Time and space efficiency are essential in algorithms. Time efficiency refers to how quickly an algorithm completes its task, 
            while space efficiency concerns how much memory is used. Both impact the scalability and performance of applications, making 
            them crucial for large datasets. Big-O notation is often used to measure these aspects.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 3: Takeaway from Chapter 2 (Design Principles) -->
        <h2>3. Takeaways from Chapter 2 (Design Principles)</h2>
        <p>
            Some key design principles include Divide and Conquer, Greedy algorithms, Dynamic Programming, and Backtracking. These 
            principles guide us in choosing the right approach to solve problems based on the problem constraints and structure.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 4: Hierarchical Data and Tree Data Structures -->
        <h2>4. Hierarchical Data and Tree Data Structures</h2>
        <p>
            Tree data structures like Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL trees, and Red-Black trees efficiently solve problems like searching, 
            insertion, and deletion in hierarchical data. These structures help optimize algorithms for operations such as database indexing, 
            file system management, and more.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 5: Need of Array Query Algorithms -->
        <h2>5. Need of Array Query Algorithms</h2>
        <p>
            Array query algorithms are crucial for optimizing access to data stored in arrays. They enable efficient searching, sorting, 
            and range querying, making them highly applicable in systems like databases, real-time data processing, and optimization tasks.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 6: Difference Between Tree and Graphs -->
        <h2>6. Difference Between Tree and Graphs</h2>
        <p>
            While trees are a type of graph, they have unique properties such as hierarchical structure and no cycles. Graphs, on the 
            other hand, are more general and can have cycles and complex relationships. Both structures have distinct traversal methods 
            and are used in different problem-solving scenarios, such as social networks (graphs) or file systems (trees).
        </p>

        <!-- Section 7: Sorting and Searching Algorithms -->
        <h2>7. Sorting and Searching Algorithms</h2>
        <p>
            Sorting algorithms like QuickSort and MergeSort help organize data, while searching algorithms like Binary Search and Linear 
            Search efficiently locate elements. These algorithms are foundational in real-world applications like e-commerce search engines, 
            databases, and machine learning.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 8: Graph Algorithms (Spanning Trees and Shortest Paths) -->
        <h2>8. Importance of Graph Algorithms (Spanning Trees and Shortest Paths)</h2>
        <p>
            Graph algorithms are fundamental for problems such as network routing, transportation planning, and optimizing systems. 
            Spanning tree algorithms like Kruskal's and Prim's help design efficient network topologies, while shortest path algorithms 
            like Dijkstra's are essential for routing in GPS systems and communication networks.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 9: Algorithm Design Techniques -->
        <h2>9. Algorithm Design Techniques</h2>
        <p>
            Common algorithm design techniques include brute force, dynamic programming, greedy methods, and divide and conquer. Each 
            approach has its strengths and weaknesses, depending on the problem structure. Understanding these techniques allows us to 
            choose the best approach for specific problems.
